We use smartphones everywhere and privacy concerns have arisen for ``shoulder surfing'', where strangers peek at our phone in public areas. This privacy threat have been studied heavily and various countermeasures have been designed, but mainly against attackers with the naked eye. With the development of smartphones and super resolution (SR) technique, we believe that this threat is underestimated as a malicious attacker can peek from farther away with the assist of his smartphone camera and SR algorithms. To underline this concern, we present SRPeek, an end-to-end system of shoulder surfing, including an unique multi-image SR neural network architecture designed for commercial smartphones. Evaluation demonstrates its efficiency and robustness, allowing a human to read 95\% of the text off a smartphone screen at 1.5m range in different scenarios only using multiple blurred images. And it outperforms other known SR algorithms and fills the blank space of multi-image SR for shoulder surfing attack.

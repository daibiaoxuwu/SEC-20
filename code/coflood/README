Chase is an open source software. We propose an efficient flooding protocol in asynchronous duty cycle networks. Basically, we develop a method to efficiently construct concurrent broadcast to remove the backoffs. The technique details are shown in our ICNP 16 paper "Chase: Taming Concurrent Broadcast for Flooding in Asynchronous Duty Cycle Networks" and TON paper "Chase: Taming Concurrent Broadcast for Flooding in Asynchronous Duty Cycle Networks". The document structure is as following. You are welcome to use Chase for your research work and cite our works.

"apps" : application code for Chase performance test.
"include" : all *.h documents.
"net" : the implementation of Chase.
"chips" : the basic CC2420 radio operation.
"interface" : all the interface used by Chase.

Chase is written in TinyOS. You need tinyos-2.1.2 or newest tinyos-main environment to compile the code.

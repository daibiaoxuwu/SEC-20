\label{sec-implementation-and-evaluation}


\subsection{Experiment Setting}
Collect data with a stationary smartphone at 1.5m range…
Display random characters on screen, with a box surrounding it for supplementary alignment…
Takes 6 hours to gather one set of training data…
\subsection{Model Specifications}
8 layers with two 2x upsampling layers; 64 channels…
\subsection{Training Process}
Collect 10 sets of data at different surroundings: different angles, distance, font size and color…
Step 1. Train the network with each one of the 10 sets, the model should fit perfectly…
Step 2. Select the set of data the model is best adapted to, and add a small percentage of images from another set…
Step 3. When the model stabilizes again, gradually increase the percentage…
Step 4. Add another set of data, and repeat step2 and 3, until all data is used.
